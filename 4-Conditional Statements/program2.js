// program to check if a number is even or odd

// check if number is divisible by 2
if (num % 2 === 0) {

}

// In this program, we start by initializing a variable num with the value 4. We then use an if-else statement to check if num is even or odd.

// To check if a number is even, we use the modulus operator (%) to check if the remainder of num divided by 2 is equal to 0. If the remainder is 0, the number is even.

// If the remainder is not 0, then the number must be odd. We use an else statement to print "The number is odd".
