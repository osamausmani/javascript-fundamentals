// program to check if a number is positive or negative

// In this program, we start by initializing a variable num with the value 5. We then use an if-else statement to check if num is positive, negative, or 0.

// If num is greater than 0, the program prints "The number is positive". If num is less than 0, the program prints "The number is negative". If both the above conditions are false, then the number must be 0, and the program prints "The number is 0".

// You can test this program by changing the value of num to a different number and running it again.
