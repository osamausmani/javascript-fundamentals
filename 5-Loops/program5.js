// Using a do-while loop to keep prompting the user until they enter a valid password in JavaScript.

let password;

do {
  password = prompt("Please enter your password:");
} while (password !== "myPassword");

console.log("Welcome, you have successfully logged in!");


// In this program, we first declare a variable called password but don't assign it a value.

// Then, we use a do-while loop to keep prompting the user to enter their password using the prompt method until they enter the correct password (in this case, "myPassword").

// Once the user enters the correct password, the loop ends and we print a welcome message to the console using console.log.

// Note that this is a simple example for demonstration purposes only - in practice, you would likely want to handle user input validation and security more carefully.
