// Using a do-while loop to get user input until a valid value is entered in JavaScript.

let input;
do {
  input = prompt("Please enter a valid value:");  // Prompt the user for input
} while (!input);  // Continue looping as long as the input is falsy

console.log("Valid input:", input);  // Print the valid input to the console

// In this program, we first declare a variable input outside the loop. Then, we use a do-while loop to repeatedly prompt the user for input using the prompt() function. The loop will continue to run as long as the value of input is falsy (i.e., empty string, null, undefined, 0, NaN, or false).

// Once the user enters a valid value, the loop will terminate and the valid input will be printed to the console using console.log().

// Note that in a do-while loop, the code inside the loop is executed at least once, even if the condition is initially false. This makes it useful for situations where you want to perform an action at least once and then repeat it based on a condition.
